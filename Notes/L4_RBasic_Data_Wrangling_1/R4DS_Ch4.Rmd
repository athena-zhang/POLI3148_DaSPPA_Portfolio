# Chapter 4

## Data Transformation

### 4.1.3 **dplyr basics:**

note: dplyr verbs r just functions

1.  The first argument is always a data frame.
2.  The subsequent arguments typically describe which columns to operate on, using the variable names (without quotes "").
3.  The output is always a new data frame.

dplyr verbs are organised into 4 groups based on what they operate on:

-   rows
-   columns
-   groups
-   tables

``` r
# to view the whole data frame
# View()
## ^ interactive scrollable and filterable view
# print(dataf, widt = Inf)
## ^ shows all columns
# glimpse()
## ^ shows all columns
```

``` r
<int> # integer
<dbl> # double (aka real numbers)
<chr> # character (aka strings)
<dttm> # date-time
```

### 4.2 ROWS

``` r
# filter()
# changes which rows are present without changing their order

dataf(variable > ....)

# %in%
## combining | and == for filtering for two or more values

filter(x %in% c(1,2))
#^ select data w variable x that satisfies value 1 or 2
```

``` r
# arrange()
# changes order of the rows whithout changing which are present

dataf |>
    arrange(a, b, c, d)
#^ arranges the rows by the smallest a to largest a, within a, the smallest 
    #to largest b etc

# arrange(desc())
# re-order the data frame based on that column in descending order
```

``` r
# distinct()
# finds all the unique rows inthe data set
## optionally modifies the columns

# distinct(x, y)
#^ finds all unique variable x and y pairs

# to keep other columns when filtering for unique rows
# use .keep_all = TRUE option
distinct(x, y, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

``` r
# count()
# find the number of occurences
# sort = TRUE argument to arrange in descendign order of number of occurences
count(x, y, sort = TRUE)
```

### 4.3 COLUMNS

``` r
# mutate()
# create new columns that are derived form the existing columns 
    #(default on the right)

# use .before argument to add new variables to the left hand side
dataf |>
    mutate(
        a = x - y
        b = z / p * 60
        .before = 1
    )
#^ adds the new columns before the 1st column

# use .before or .after argument to add variable before and after a certain variable
.before = x
.after = y

# use .keep argument to control which variables are kept
    # use .keep = "used" to specify only keep the columns that were involved 
    # or created in the mutate() step
```

``` r
# select()
# changes which columns are present

dataf |>
    select(a, b, c)
#^ select columns by name

dataf |>
    select(a:c)
#^ select all columns between a and c (inclusive)

dataf |>
    select(!a:c)
#^ select all columns except those from a:c (inclusive

dataf |>
    select(wehre(is.character))
#^ select all columns that are characters

# other helper functions:

starts_with("abc")
    # matches names that begin with "abc"

ends_with("xyz")
    # matches names that end with "xyz"

contains("ijk")
    # matches names that contain "ijk"

num_range("x", 1:3)
    # matches x1, x2 and x3

##^ see ?select for more details

#use = argument to rename variables whilst select()
    #^ new name appears on the left hand side of the =
    #^ old variable appears on the right hand side
dataf |>
    select(x_new = x_old)
```

``` r
# rename()
# changes the names of the columns (keeps all exsiting variables)
dataf |>
    rename(x_new = x_old)

## try janitor::clean_names() for automated cleaning of column names
```

``` r
# relocate()
# changes the positions of the columns (default: moves variables to the front)
dataf |>
    relocate(m, n)
# m n a b c ...

# specify with .before and .after argument
dataf |>
    relocate(g:j, .after = b)

dataf |>
    relocate(starts_with("p"), .before = d)
```

### 4.4 The pipe `|>` or `%>%`

-   easier than nesting each function call inside the previous call
-   easier than using a bunch of intermediate objects

``` r
dataf |>
    filter(...) |>
    mutate(...) |>
    select(...) |>
    arrange(...)
    
```

### 4.5 GROUPS

``` r
# group_by()
# divide dataset into groups meaningfulfor analysis

dataf |>
    group_by(month)
# Groups: month [12]
#^ means subsequent operions will now work "by month"

# can also group with more than one variable
daily <- dataf |>
    group_by(year, month, day)
# makes a group for each date
```

``` r
# summarize()
# reduces the data frame to a have a single row for each group

dataf |>
    group_by(month) |>
    summarize(
        x_mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
# month x_mean
# <int> <dbl>
# 1 1   32.1
# etc for 12 rows

#^ remember na.rm is to ignore NA values

# use n() argument for a sumamry of the number of rows in each group
dataf |>
    group_by(month) |>
    summarize(
        x_mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
    )
# month x_mean n
# <int> <dbl> <int>
# 1 1   32.1  9457
# etc for 12 rows

# summarising when tibble is grouped by more than one variable
## note that each summary peels off the last group
daily)flighrts <- daily |>
    summarize(n=n())
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using
#> the `.groups` argument.

#use .groups argument to explicity request "peeling" behavior in order to 
    #suppress the message
daily_flights <- daily |> 
  summarize(
    n = n(), 
    .groups = "drop_last"
  )

#alternatively, change the defuault behavior by setting a different value, 
# e.g., "drop" to drop all grouping or "keep" to preserve the same groups
```

#### 4.5.3 `slice_` functions - extracts specific rows within each group

-   `df |> slice_head(n = 1)` takes the first row from each group.
-   `df |> slice_tail(n = 1)` takes the last row in each group.
-   `df |> slice_min(x, n = 1)` takes the row with the smallest value of column `x`.
-   `df |> slice_max(x, n = 1)` takes the row with the largest value of column `x`.
-   `df |> slice_sample(n = 1)` takes one random row.

Note: vary n = to select more than 1 row OR

use prop = 0.1 to select e.g. 10% of the rows in each group

``` r
# use with_ties = FALSE argument to slice exactly one row per group
## shows whole corresponding row instead of single summary statistic with 
    ## summarize()
```

#### 4.5.5 `ungroup`ing

``` r
#use ungroup() function to remove grouping from a data frame without using 
#summarize()

dataf |>
    ungroup()

# now summarize an ungrouped data fram shows:
dataf |>
    ungroup() \>
    summarize(
        avg_x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
        y = n()
    )
# avg_x y
# <dbl> <int>
#1 12.6 3473948

#^single row because dplyr treats all the rows in an ungrouped data frame as 
#belonging to one group
```

#### 4.5.6 `.by`

``` r
#use .by argument to group within a single operation

dataf |> 
  summarize(
    avg_x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), 
    n = n(),
    .by = month
  )

# or group by multible variables

flights |> 
  summarize(
    delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 
    n = n(),
    .by = c(origin, dest)
  )

#works with all verbs
# don't need groups argument to suppress the grouping message
# don't need to ungroup()
```
